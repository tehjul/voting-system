## Simple voting system

A smart contract that allows to register voters on a whitelist with their ethereum address. Once registered, they can submit one or many proposals and they can vote once for a proposal.

The differents steps are managed by a workflow status that only the administrator of the contract can change.

The most voted proposal wins and everyone can check the winner once the votes are closed.
